# TypeScript Node.js Server

Welcome! This project is a simple Node.js server written in TypeScript. If you’re new to this, don’t worry—I’ll walk you through everything you need to get started.

## Running the Server

This project has three main ways to start the server, depending on what you’re doing.

 Here’s a quick summary:

- **npm run dev →** Runs the server with ts-node in development mode.
- **npm run build →** Converts TypeScript to JavaScript inside dist/.
- **npm start →** Runs the compiled JavaScript server in production mode.
